RHEL relies on yum to install OS features as packages.  Some packages rely
on others as dependencies and must load them first.  Some packages are very
specific about the version of a package and refuse to load anything else so
accessing additional repositories or changing the version desired may be 
required.

Package Installation
$ sudo yum install -y <package>
$ sudo yum uninstall -y <package>
$ sudo yum group install <group name>
