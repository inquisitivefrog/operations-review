Basics
1) Assumes IaaS layer already architected so only need to roll out
   higher level configuration such as
   a) users, groups
   b) firewall, selinux
   c) Linux services
   d) monitor service
   e) CI/CD service
   f) custom app service
2) as these configurations are often tier specific or node specific, OK to
   a) define in templates 
   b) assign nodes to templates
3) if using Master/Slave model, then would also need to install slave agent
   service

Strategic Questions
1) Should implementation of configuration changes fail completely on error?
   YES
   a) easy to identify mistake
   b) avoid wasting time causing other issues such as when services depend
      on each other
   NO
   a) good to know at a glance how bad things truly are
      even if including false positives
   b) avoid fixing then time-consuming retrying step by step
2) Should output always be noisy or only on failure?
   YES
   a) confirms what was done even though it passed
   b) use pattern search to find state automatically
   NO
   a) we only care about failure and noisy doesn't help if service not
      configured to start at all
