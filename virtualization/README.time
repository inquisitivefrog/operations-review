Virtual Nodes start when spun up so syncing the clock immediately afterwards
is important but if preserving environment later, clock will be stopped 
meaning a resume will have a clock off by whatever delta the VM was offline
so again, resyncing the clock immediately after startup is crucial.

Use ntp preferably from an external network source that is not virtualized.
